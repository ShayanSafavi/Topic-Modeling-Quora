# Topic-Modeling-Quora
The goal of this project is to identify and assign 20 topics to a dataset extracted from Quora website. This dataset includes 40,000 questions and data is stored in quora_questions.csv file.\
I am using non negative matrix factorization to assign 20 topics (topic #0 ... topic #19) to 40,000 questions in a dataset extracted from Quora website.
